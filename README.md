# Sample_neural_Network
A neural network mimics brain processing using layers of interconnected neurons. It includes an input layer (features), hidden layers (processing units), and an output layer (results). Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) introduce non-linear feedforward neural network in Keras for binary classification with layers: input, hidden, and output.
